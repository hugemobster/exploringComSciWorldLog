# Learning Log

Welcome to **Exploring the CS World Log**! This is a blog/log that chronicles my learning journey in computer science. From exploring new programming languages to diving deep into system-level topics, this repo contains the knowledge, challenges, and progress I make along the way.

## About

Throughout this repo, I'll document my studies and personal projects. 

As of now my areas of interest are:
- Rust
- Docker
- Functional programming (Haskell, OCaml)
- Distributed Systems, Operating Systems

I’ll break down the concepts I learn, my thought process, the challenges I encounter, and how I tackle them. This log is both for me to track my progress and for anyone interested in learning alongside me.

It's important to note that I won't be regular with posting throughout the year, I am a university student. Hence, based on my availability I could be more or less regular with working on this. The hope is that since this is public and technically everyone is watching, it sort of motivates me to keep this going.
